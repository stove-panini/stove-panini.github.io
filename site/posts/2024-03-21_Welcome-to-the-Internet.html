<p>Okay, so the website is finally deployed in earnest. I remember using GitHub Pages a few years ago and building it with the default choice of Jekyll and having an okay time. This time around, however, I chose to roll my own static site builder via a combination of <a href="https://kristaps.bsd.lv/lowdown/">lowdown</a> and trusty old Bash. The repo is <a href="https://github.com/stove-panini/stove-panini.github.io">here</a>.</p>
<p>Now, I am by no means a web developer (Can you tell?), and I have to say that CSS is crazy!! Widths and sizes never seem to behave how I would expect. So much time was spent in the Developer Tools pane. But we&#8217;re here! We did it!</p>
<p>I started out with a &#8220;no layout&#8221; approach, approximating a no-frills, readable, Web 1.0 thing. I wanted to avoid anything complicated. Then I realized that everything looks way too big and padded on small screens. Okay, I guess I&#8217;ll have to actually design something. A column of content and two more columns, one on either side, that provide padding on big screens and simply go away on small screens. There! Design complete!</p>
<p>Now that that&#8217;s out of the way, I plan to use this website as a general purpose journal.</p>
<p>A WEB LOG, IF YOU WILL.</p>
