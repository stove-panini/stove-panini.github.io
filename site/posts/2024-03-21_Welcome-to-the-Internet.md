Okay, so the website is finally deployed in earnest. I remember using GitHub Pages a few years ago and building it with the default choice of Jekyll and having an okay time. This time around, however, I chose to roll my own static site builder via a combination of [lowdown](https://kristaps.bsd.lv/lowdown/) and trusty old Bash. The repo is [here](https://github.com/stove-panini/stove-panini.github.io).

Now, I am by no means a web developer (Can you tell?), and I have to say that CSS is crazy!! Widths and sizes never seem to behave how I would expect. So much time was spent in the Developer Tools pane. But we're here! We did it!

I started out with a "no layout" approach, approximating a no-frills, readable, Web 1.0 thing. I wanted to avoid anything complicated. Then I realized that everything looks way too big and padded on small screens. Okay, I guess I'll have to actually design something. A column of content and two more columns, one on either side, that provide padding on big screens and simply go away on small screens. There! Design complete!

Now that that's out of the way, I plan to use this website as a general purpose journal.

A WEB LOG, IF YOU WILL.
